# ClipCollections

ClipCollections is a simple tool that helps Twitch streamers organize their clips into collections for easy sharing and improved discoverability. Create collections of your best moments, game settings, loadouts, or any other category you want.

## How it works

1. Create a collection by giving it a name and adding the Twitch clips you want to include.
2. Copy the shareable link and create a chat command for your viewers to access the collection, such as "!loadouts" or "!csgo".
